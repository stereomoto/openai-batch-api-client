[question](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/?f=flair_name%3A%22question%22) I am torn between wanting to promote my career and work online via LinkedIn and also not wanting to be publicly exposed or searchable via google. Is there a way to use LinkedIn that doesn't make me searchable or share my posts publicly beyond my connections. A mode where you can maintain your close circle without broadcasting everywhere else? This could also be an open discussion instead of just a question, I am curious how people can be successful and grow business while also maintaining a level of privacy. Read more Archived post.

If you want private, go for something like facebook or any other social media service. Just don't provide linkedin with personal details. Go and get yourself a public facing address, email and phone number.

You can test what is visible yourself by making another LinkedIn account and searching for your primary LinkedIn account while logged in to the new one. Public profile settings only apply to what people can see when they are not logged in to linkedin. There is NO way to control what people who are not your connections see with the exception of your profile photo, your last name, and your other connections (but you can still be found from search with your last name). Your summary, headline, education, posts and activity, experience, volunteer/organizations, and recommendations (anything that is a section on your linkedin profile) is visible to ANYONE logged in to linkedin, and there is no way to change this. To make it worse, people have the ability to make their views of your profile private/anonymous, and there’s really in theory no limit to the number of accounts you can make, so if you have a serious safety concern for privacy like a harasser or a stalker, even if you know who it is, they can just make a new account with private view mode so you can’t possibly block them. I would recommend you and anyone else trying to figure this out flag this for LinkedIn — if enough people complain maybe they will make an option. It’s insane IMO that you can’t control this.

It’s straightforward enough… that is, until you get to LinkedIn. It’s surprisingly difficult to update your resume once it’s been uploaded to the platform.

Whether it’s time to update your resume on LinkedIn mostly depends on whether there have been any significant changes to your work or career goals. While you should generally aim to keep your LinkedIn profile updated (every 6-12 months is ideal), you should also update your resume on LinkedIn whenever: - **You change jobs.** Your resume should accurately reflect your current position, even if you’re not actively searching. - **You get a promotion.** Likewise, it pays to update your resume any time your title or responsibilities change. Think of it as preventative maintenance — it’s a lot less effort to make a few small changes now than it will be to try to remember exactly what you did years down the line. - **You’re actively job searching.** If you’re currently looking for a job, you may need to update your resume more frequently than normal — check in at least every couple of months to make sure your resume aligns with what you’re looking for and is getting you the right results. If it isn’t, consider using a free online tool like [Score My Resume](https://resumeworded.com/score) for personalized feedback. **Want a free resume review instantly?** Drop your resume here or [choose a file.](https://resumeworded.com/upload-resume-no-login-no-text#) English resumes in PDF or DOCX only.

However, if your goal is to generate leads or recruit talent, you will quickly **face limitations**. The LinkedIn Basic Account is **free forever.** LinkedIn will never charge LinkedIn members for accessing the basic features. ![How To Use Linkedin Boolean Search? [2025 Step-by-Step Tutorial]](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0AFc5KkxJKs/hqdefault.jpg) Here’s what is included in the **LinkedIn basic account** plan: 1.

Using the search engine to find profiles You can also use [LinkedIn Boolean search](https://evaboot.com/blog/linkedin-boolean-search) on the free search engine to build **targeted lead and candidate lists**. ## LinkedIn Free Account Limitations There are some [limitations to having a free LinkedIn](https://evaboot.com/blog/linkedin-limits) membership: 1. The search result limitation 2. The commercial use limit 3. No access to 2nd and 3rd-degree connections 4. No access to profile viewers ![linkedin free account limitation](https://evaboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/linkedin-free-account-limitation.png) ### 1\\. The search result limitation The **search results** of the LinkedIn free search engine are composed of **100 pages of 10 results**. ![linkedin free account search results](https://evaboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/linkedin-free-account.png) It means you can only see the first **1000 results** of your searches. You can’t get access to the rest. ### 2\\. The commercial use limit The most annoying thing for free LinkedIn users is the [commercial use limit](https://evaboot.com/blog/hack-to-bypass-linkedin-search-limit): It means that if LinkedIn detects that you’re intensively using the **free search engine** to generate leads or find candidates, **they will block your access.** ![linkedin commercial use limit](https://evaboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/linkedin-commercial-use-limit.webp) You won’t be able to use the search engine anymore and will need to **wait until the end of the month** to use it again. These **limitations can be lifted** by the following LinkedIn premium plans. ### 3\\. No access to 2nd and 3rd-degree connections With LinkedIn free accounts, you don’t get [InMail credits](https://evaboot.com/blog/linkedin-inmail-credits). It means you are **forced to send connection requests** if you want to contact people out of your network. ![linkedin free account limit](https://evaboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/linkedin-free-account-limit.png) Given that **50% of connection requests get accepted on average**, it really compromises your LinkedIn prospecting capacity and your ability to expand your professional network. ### 4\\. No access to profile viewers You **can’t access your profile views** with the free version of LinkedIn. ![who viewed your profile linkedin premium feature](https://evaboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/who-viewed-your-profile-linkedin-premium-feature.png) You’ll miss a **source of qualified leads** or potentially interested candidates. * * * Let’s see how LinkedIn premium plans can help you **overcome these limitations** and reach your goals. You will see that **LinkedIn premium costs** are low compared to the return on investment you can get from LinkedIn premium accounts. ## LinkedIn Premium Career LinkedIn Premium Career costs **$29.99 per month. Or $239 per year** if you pay annually. ![linkedin premium career cost](https://evaboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png) [LinkedIn Premium Career](https://premium.linkedin.com/pm) has been designed to help you get a job faster.

Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re 21 with several jobs, and one is “CEO”. You might get scoffed at, and it risks removing credibility from your entire LinkedIn profile. Remember, CEO conjure up images of, and is used by people who have dozens of staff, large budgets, many decades of experience. Budding CEOs (newbies to business) are a whole other category. Therefore someone might misinterpret that you’re trying to appear more than you are (viewed as full of hot air) and may discount you for roles. My suggestion…. Get rid of the word “CEO”, and replace it with “entrepreneur”. Entrepreneurs are amazing people with gumption, insight, and drive. These are awesome qualities. Therefore, with this revision, it would look like the part after the crossed-out section). * * * First, I took out Walmart. It stuck out more than anything else (ie, one of these things is not like the others). Unfortunately Walmart has a stigma, despite being able to develop great skillsets there. So let’s take out Walmart and leave the skills (you may also want to take Walmart out of your LinkedIn’s main body as well, EDIT, but because I now see that you’re 21, and you don’t have a long work history, you have the option of leaving Walmart in your other longer LinkedIn history. Depends how long you were there. Couple years, leave it in. A few months, take it out). As for the rest… I removed the bullets and replaced them with long vertical dividers to make it look less like a bulleted resume and more like an informative paragraph, but with clear delineations to be emphasized. The original headline is lengthy, somewhat repetitive, and reads more like a resume bullet point list than a concise professional introduction. I made the headline more broad and clear. The improved headline is succinct, gets straight to the point, and emphasizes key professional attributes without redundancy. i positioned the headline for versatility. By using terms like ""Versatile"" and emphasizing ""Sales & Consultation Acumen"", the new headline suggests adaptability and transferable skills, making you appeal to a broader range of industries and roles. It now highlights Key Achievements. The original mentioned the CEO role and ownership of a furniture company, but the phrasing ""no longer operational"" might raise questions about the success or challenges faced by that business. But now it focuses on the achievement (""Proven Leadership as Former CEO"") without unnecessary details that could be perceived negatively. Again, back fo removing Walmart, I keep in the valuable skillset of being Customer Service Focused gained from that experience (and presumable from the others as well. Walmart referred to a role in customer service but didn’t emphasize the broader skill of customer service excellence. By referring to yourself as a ""Champion of Customer Service Excellence"", the new headline amplifies this valuable soft skill without tying it specifically to one past role. I also highlighted Current Expertise without Over-Narrowing. You originally mentioned the current role as a ""construction consultant and sales for a company"", but that can pigeonhole you into a specific niche (ie, recruiters may think that’s your only desired profession). Therefore I revised it to stage ""Versatile Construction Specialist"" alludes to expertise in the construction domain but doesn't limit you strictly to that industry. By pairing it with ""Strong Sales & Consultation Acumen"", it emphasizes that your skills are broader and can be applied in various contexts. There was a problem in the original with overall professional image. The original gave an impression of someone sharing a work history without a clear brand or professional image. But now the new headline projects a professional image of someone who is versatile, has a rich history of leadership, is skilled in sales and consultation, and is dedicated to customer service excellence. The revised headline paints a picture of a well-rounded, adaptable professional with diverse expertise, making you more appealing to a wider range of potential employers or business partners. Hope this helps. Good luck!

And yes hundred percent agree with the CEO statement, i am young and not that new in the CEO world, entrepreneurs are more suited plus that is where I want to connect with as well so thanks for highlighting that. So i am inclined towards Versatile Construction Specialist with Strong Sales & Consultation Acumen \\| and vice versa that you wrote. Once again super super thankful for clearing my doubts !!

Your headline should give people a summary of what you do or what your interests are, not unrelated things you did in the past. You'll need to provide a little more detail about your background/studies to create a headline that makes sense. Exactly what kind of roles are you hoping to go for in the future?

LinkedIn Premium costs **$29.99 per month** if you opt for its career-focused package LinkedIn Premium Career, or **$59.99 per month** if you subscribe to its plan for business and managers LinkedIn Business Premium. ### How much does LinkedIn Premium cost per year? LinkedIn Premium costs **$239 per year** for job-seekers and professionals using LinkedIn Premium Career, or **$575.88 per year** for business and managers using LinkedIn Business Premium. ## LinkedIn Basic Explained LinkedIn offers a free-of-change, basic membership for users looking to create and maintain a professional profile online. LinkedIn Basic is ideal for individuals looking to improve their online presence, connect with people in their industry, and search for job opportunities. Below we list some ways LinkedIn users can benefit from the Basic plan. ### LinkedIn Basic key features - Build your professional identity - Search and view other LinkedIn profiles - Connect and network with other LinkedIn profiles - Request and give recommendations - Request five introductions at a time - Receive InMail messages - See who’s viewed your profile for five days - Conduct up to 100 profile searches LinkedIn Basic **does have some limitations**, however. If you use the free plan you aren’t able to send messages to profiles you’re not connected to, you’re only able to see who has viewed your profile for the past five days, and your searches are limited. **Who should use LinkedIn Basic?** Due to LinkedIn Basic’s affordability, it’s ideal for **casual job seekers**, **students**, and **small business owners**. Its search cap and InMail restrictions make it less suitable for active job seekers and larger companies, however. ## LinkedIn Premium Career Explained LinkedIn Premium Career is LinkedIn’s premium package for job seekers. It offers everything included in the platform’s Basic tier, plus a range of expanded and new features. For instance, in order to **[use LinkedIn’s new AI tools](https://tech.co/news/how-to-use-new-ai-features-linkedin)**, you’ll need a Premium account. In a recent LinkedIn survey, it was found job seekers using LinkedIn Premium were hired 2x faster that those using its free plan. This suggests the plan is ideal for individuals looking to get a new job quickly. Read on to learn more about the benefits of the plan and how they’re designed to make it easier for users to expand their professional network and access career opportunities. ### Premium Profile Badge Premium Career users will have the option to display a gold badge on their profile picture and search results. This badge helps users stand out from other job applicants and sends a clear message to recruiters that they’re serious about making connections and exploring new opportunities. ### More profile searches Unlike Linked Basic, which imposes monthly search caps, the Premium Career plan doesn’t limit the amount of profile searches you can make. This makes it easier for job seekers to browse profiles up to 3rd-degree connections, and increase the size of their professional network. ### More InMail Options Individuals using this plan are also able to use InMail to message people outside of their professional network. Unlike most other messaging mediums, once you’ve mailed the recipient, they will be able to see who you are, as well as a blow-by-blow of your professional history. With findings from LinkedIn revealing that people are 4.6x more likely to reply to an InMail than a standard email, this feature is a huge bonus for individuals looking to boost their visibility and make value connections. ### Featured Applicant Status With LinkedIn Premium, you receive recommendations for roles where you’d be considered a top applicant from recruiters. You can also apply for these jobs being highlighted as a “Featured Applicant”, and your job application will also automatically be prioritized over non-applicant members. ### LinkedIn Learning LinkedIn Premium Career users also get unlimited access to the website’s in-house learning platform LinkedIn Learning, unlocking access to relevant personalized e-learning content and helping them take the next step in their careers. The platform library offers courses in seven languages, spanning topics like creativity, diversity and inclusion, and leadership and management. ![LinkedIn learning platform screenshot](https://images.tech.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/16095742/02-tab-e01-v01.png) LinkedIn learning platform screenshot. Source: learning.linkedin.com ### See Who Has Viewed Your Page While Basic members are only able to see who viewed their profile in the last five days, Premium members can see the names and occupations of everyone who has checked out their account in the last 90 days. Premium users also gain insights into how these accounts found your profile, helping them optimize their profile and increase their overall visibility. **Who should use LinkedIn Premium Career?** Due to the plan’s enhanced professional features, it’s a great option for **job seekers** serious about **increasing their visibility** and **finding opportunities fast**. It’s also a great package for users working towards their professional goals, as long as they’re able to spare the monthly costs. ## LinkedIn Premium Business Explained LinkedIn Premium Business is the platform’s premium tier designed specifically for business owners and managers. The package offers a number of advantages from the free plan, including access to detailed analytics, and improved sales and networking features. Take a look at some of LinkedIn Premium Business’s capabilities below. ### LinkedIn Premium Business key features - 15 InMail messages per month - Unlimited searches - LinkedIn Learning access - See who’s viewed your profile for 90 days - Detailed business Insights LinkedIn Business Career is a great way to utilize the platform’s networking, marketing, and sales features. It’s especially suited toward sales teams looking to optimize their prospecting, lead generation, and lead management processes. However, dedicated sales teams with more advanced needs may benefit more from the website’s Sale Navigator package, as it offers 50 InMail credits per month, custom alerts on leads, and enhanced boolean search queries for only **$40** more **per month**. **Who should use LinkedIn Premium Business?** If you’re a **business owner or manager** looking to **improve your hiring potential** and **expand your professional network** LinkedIn Premium Business will be worth the investment. However, teams using the platform to drive up sales performance will be better off opting for LinkedIn Sales Navigator, instead. ## Why Is LinkedIn Premium So Expensive? At **$29.99 per month** for its job seeker package and **$59.99 per month** for its business package, LinkedIn Premium isn’t cheap. However, since LinkedIn is the business world’s default professional network, it offers an unrivaled way to get your name out, develop your professional network, and connect with recruiters and candidates. With the average job search costing workers on a $50k salary an average of $40k – according to figures CareerBuilder – paying a premium to unlock LinkedIn’s potential will be a worthwhile investment for candidates serious about landing opportunities quickly. The same can be said for businesses looking to source new talent. Hiring continues to be one of the top expenses for businesses, so it makes sense that LinkedIn charges a notable amount for useful benefits like unlimited people browsing, company analytics and enhanced visibility. ### Verdict: Is LinkedIn Premium Worth It? Considering the unfettered access you get to LinkedIn’s career-building, job-hunting, and networking features, **LinkedIn Premium Career is definitely worth it** for job seekers looking to stand out from the competition. The premium tier can also be a great investment for individuals in full-time employment who prioritize growing in their career and seeking a community of like-minded professionals. Adorning a slightly larger price tag of **$59.99 per month**, **LinkedIn Premium Career** will be worth it for businesses and managers that are restricted by LinkedIn basics stringent search and messaging limits. However,  we think its value offering is slightly less competitive than LinkedIn’s Sales Navigator package. So if you’re using LinkedIn to further your sales strategy, we’d recommend investing a few more dollars a month into this package instead.

You earned a promotion, and you're ready to add your new title to LinkedIn. Unfortunately, adding a promotion to your profile is not as straightforward as you might think. This guide will walk you through how to add a new job within the same company to your LinkedIn work experience, as well as the different ways you can share your promotion with your LinkedIn network. ‍ ## How to add a promotion on LinkedIn There are two ways to add an additional position with the same employer: edit your current experience or add a new position. Here are the basic steps: 1. Add your new job title to your experience section 2. Review your changes 3. Share your promotion with your network We'll outline the different methods for adding and posting your promotion on LinkedIn. To get started, open your LinkedIn website in a separate tab or window and click your profile photo in the top right corner to view profile. ‍ ### **Option 1: Edit your experience to add your promotion to your LinkedIn** Once you're on your LinkedIn profile, you'll want to navigate down to the Experience section to make updates. This method will use your current job information to add your new position. ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db883916_660c65ebc9d492f3d0a0f746_linkedin-edit-profile.jpeg) ‍ To edit your experience, click on LinkedIn's pencil icons. Confusingly, you have to do this twice. First, scroll down to your work experience. Click the pencil in the top right-hand corner of the section. This will cause pencil icons to appear by all your positions. ‍ ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db883908_660c662d7fbc44b4b4097723_linkedin-edit-profile.jpeg) ‍ Second, find your current employer in your experience section. Click on the pencil icon corresponding to your most recent job title. This will bring up a box labeled “edit experience.” The first text box has your job title. Delete that text and enter your new title. Don't worry; we'll be able to keep them both! Entering a new title should trigger a new prompt immediately below the text box you've just edited. LinkedIn will ask “Did you get promoted? Add a new position to show your career progression.” Click the “ + Add new position” blue text to add your promotion. ‍ ‍ ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db8838ea_660c665444e0c9d0c3e58d1c_edit-job-history-linkedin.jpeg) Go ahead and do a little happy dance, too. You earned it! Note: if your titles are similar, LinkedIn may not recognize this as a new position. In that case, follow the steps for option two. ‍ ### **Option 2: Add your promotion as a new position to your LinkedIn profile** ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db883916_660c65ebc9d492f3d0a0f746_linkedin-edit-profile.jpeg) ‍ Instead of editing your current position, you can add your promotion as though you were adding an entirely new job. To do this, scroll down to your experience section. Click on the plus sign. ‍ ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db8838f0_660c66c15974a4fe45c27a09_how%2520to%2520add%2520promotion%2520on%2520linkedin.jpeg) _Adding new position on LinkedIn_ ‍Click on “add position” and move on to the next step. ‍ ### **Add your new experience** ‍This should look familiar. This is the same way you added your other work experience to LinkedIn. ![LinkedIn promotion step 7](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/62fe9454a4e56d6476dd5035_mo7anw6HhuFy_WDrWT7E10-vg_1jfe06jtyTrXgXLznRCjuVP9j2oJ1ro96F_K_h8BAwTI9bJa49WrYVLNB4xrWdX3hZQSgcx0PXKJ5Y3AcUTF07g8Z_e5L7g3vXNkRnp2bY4hkjEGqBLlIgezAFZSM.png) ‍ The top section of this “add experience” window gives you the option to “notify network” of changes. Toggle this on or off now so you don't forget after you've made your changes. If you accessed this window by editing your current job, you will already see your new job title and employer information. If you're adding your promotion as a new position, enter this information manually. ‍ ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db8838ea_660c665444e0c9d0c3e58d1c_edit-job-history-linkedin.jpeg) ‍ You'll need to add your employment type, company name, location, and industry manually. Since you have the same employer, this information will remain identical. Be mindful of adding exactly the same employer information—your promotion won't display correctly otherwise. Again, this information will be filled out for you if you choose the “add a promotion” route. ‍ ![LinkedIn promotion step 9](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/62fe948dc31cff57ccf5cdce_IAmwLKI-5rDEP6oDwrZxV35QCXLpilt_cFubJ6mFTQSYmS7iA2LAztOsngDjjCzVcMlpNeDqxvvy5sL3vxYDoPstlEO61QSzLh87nnDr00isaoTlFZWQwyxghwOtzL_mAGa5iPegkO-vU5rZi7tOsjw.png) ‍ You can adjust your start date at this stage, as well as select the option to “end current position as of now.” These options come in handy if you're updating your public profile after the promotion has taken place. ‍ ![LinkedIn promotion step 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/62fe948daaf5e8428d2203fa_By80CPvmqdvv9H4659z0eMPagToJlBOEdVDeHkY0HwFf0Jm3czzg__LjQ1DAmCfvZZ8f5V-I8ehHhs92qq7gyeT5Rsw1gulib8F5GqbOrhlKI5Yu12OHaMJroYk29vJjNDNYnF0lce8492qm54hfCXw.png) ‍ You can add a description of your new role. It's fine to skip this section for now and come back when you can better describe your impact in your promoted position. ‍ ![LinkedIn promotion step 11](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/62fe948d39e135c9e66feda3_DoVimWbWsHg9V317A3JYo25bKj751hv1Mg4DCtTphLs4DC1KUX8KIm8Y3XZhN-RqbhZVrp0cqjd1rtJWQP8NZJv3Wb8sK6HKZQkgu6UlL1WvVhujZFXi1BallefKrgBQ8Lpjiw-xIR0pdUuZ9mDmB9E.jpeg) _Updating your LinkedIn profile headline to show your new promotion or new role_ ‍ Your [profile headline](https://www.tealhq.com/post/linkedin-headlines-for-job-seekers) may or may not be the same as your current job title. You can make changes from this window to reflect your promotion. ‍ ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db88391d_660c679851a922e47c3be864_Linkedin-skills-section-to-jobs.jpeg) ‍ LinkedIn allows you to showcase skills you use in specific roles. This will list skills within your experience section as well as in your skills section. Use Teal’s Skills Database in the free [Skills Workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wSLZZyKc7J5MxjFxacEV3A6vUnfU9_Te8ytj67aBsqQ/edit#gid=154538409) to identify your current hard and soft skills and potential skills that you want to acquire. Once you've identified those, enter them into Teal’s Skills Identifier. ![Present your best self by identifying and leveraging your top skills.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66aa5494d3548e6ec3f65529_637becfdd51bb19152bea40f_skills%2520workbook.gif) Present your best self by identifying and leveraging your top skills. ‍ Note: this is not available for profiles that already maxed out LinkedIn's 50 skill limit. ![LinkedIn promotion step 13](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/62fe948d7946eb8a36a1774e_QYJmqSvROR3TyLUSPXfdILDRUMbad4UqtCbbLvDAaFbgpiC8NckXVMBCB1D7lkWdD5MxO-3333LEPhqn7Iu0NjBzAo-2VRa8I92-wTFtnQbqCyaHPIhkfDO5y3EJfeJFcSLmOZHdYr2uVnjYQdr1VKc.png) The last section here is a media section. Like the description, you can come back to this when you have more time in this position. Remember to save your changes! ‍ ### **Review and save your changes** As many writers and editors know, the best time to spot your typos is right after saving your changes (or sending an email). After you click save, refresh your page and double-check that the changes you made are in fact correct. ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db883902_660c67cfc40692c86a6585e7_linkedin-work-section.jpeg) Review the start date, the job title, and any other changes you made in the “add experience” popup window. If you added a new position instead of adding a promotion, use this opportunity to check that the positions are nested under one company profile. If not, troubleshoot by ensuring the employer is exactly the same for both and that the dates don't overlap. Look for common typos: - “Manger” instead of “manager” - “Principal” instead of “principle” (or vice versa for school administrators) - “Buisness” instead of “business” - “Pubic” instead of “public” - “Liason” or “liasion” instead of “liaison” - “An” instead of “and” ‍ ## **How to share profile updates with your network** Many people still have LinkedIn's default job update settings, meaning the platform will notify your connections when you make a change to your employment. This is one way that you can notify your network about your new promotion, just by adding the new position to your experience section. If you want to change this default setting, heres how to do it: You can change these settings for all your updates in the “visibility” section of your settings by clicking on “share profile updates with your network.” ![LinkedIn promotion step 15](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/62fe948dc8e7bac58ced4837_fXb21nBUFo750BFpAKAMnNLSPQTMcB8fMhMlxTpFcUlZiIMbmgATXnmH5PPDlobNuxUGABCwtfJ5zh50sl6RSaSHIa_O71JZqUnMHnZcJwmw8oAc4UlLDyMEdpx5zhwwqNqCoUp-1s8Llt0uKZpBj1o.jpeg) ‍ ## How to post promotion on LinkedIn Whether you opt to share this notification or not, consider making a post to [announce your new job on LinkedIn](https://www.tealhq.com/post/how-to-announce-your-new-job-on-linkedin). Your network (hopefully!) wants to celebrate your career progress with you, so give your former classmates and coworkers the chance to congratulate you. When announcing your promotion with your network, you'll also have the opportunity to adjust your post privacy settings and choose whether you want to announce your promotion publicly or just with your network. ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627c8700df0be67c4b1d533c/66abea58af1f1873db883905_660c682bd184ccd33b83543f_sharing-promotion-on-linkedin.jpeg) ‍ ## What should be included in your job promotion post on LinkedIn Consider announcing that all your hard work has paid off with a heartfelt message of gratitude, recognition, and appreciation. Of course, you want to make sure the timing is right before posting, as you don't want the news to come as a shock to any former or new coworkers. We suggest waiting until you have formally accepted the role and have clearly communicated changes to all involved parties before updating your LinkedIn web page. You don't need to go too in depth if you don't want to, but creating a post announcing your promotion on LinkedIn is a great way to notify your network, keep your target audience updated, and showcase advancements in your career. We suggest to include the following in your LinkedIn job status update: 1. Announce your departure and [highlight positives](https://www.tealhq.com/post/what-are-you-most-proud-of) from your previous position. This could include professional accomplishments and key achievements in that role, as well as what you've learned and how you've grown. 2. Provide positive recognition of colleagues who have supported you throughout your career journey. 3. Adequately describe your job update by providing a few job details you look forward to performing in the new job position. 4. In addition to showing your gratitude, show your excitement for what's next. Acknowledge the alignment of this job role and company culture with your own values, interests, and skills. Getting a promotion is a big deal, but how little or how much you share about job promotions and job changes on your LinkedIn account is completely up to you. Whatever you choose, do it professionally and respectfully. ‍ ### **How long should I wait to update LinkedIn with my promotion?** Similar to starting a new job, it's best to [wait two weeks to update LinkedIn](https://www.tealhq.com/post/when-to-update-linkedin-with-new-job). If you're sure this new position is what you want in your career, you might feel comfortable sharing the news right away. ‍ ### Example posts announcing your new job title on your LinkedIn profile > Exciting news!

It depends on your settings. As of 2024, LinkedIn defaults to sharing job title updates with your network. You can change this from your settings or from the “add experience” window. ‍ ### How can I change my job title without notifying my network? In the “add experience” window, LinkedIn gives you the option to “notify network” of changes. Toggle this ""off"" before updating your profile. Once you save the changes, your LinkedIn profile will be updated without notifying your network. ### How can I delete the job update LinkedIn shared with my network? Go to your profile. Click on “show all activity.” Any recent posts from you will be here. When you see the one notifying your network of a job update, click the three dots in the upper right-hand corner. Then click on “delete post” to remove it. ‍ ### Should I add my promotion on other social media sites? You can, especially if you added your previous title.
